<h2>How do tickets work for Hyperborea?</h2>
<p class="help-block">Since demand for Hyperborea tickets outnumbers supply, <strong>the first stage of getting a ticket is registering for the ticket lottery</strong>. Our ticket registration opens on January 19th, 2021 [and closes?].</p>
<p class="help-block">If you’ve volunteered in the past, you get to bypass the general ticket sale lottery. Directed volunteer ticket sales open on February 2nd. Completing your volunteer hours is the best way to ensure a Hyperborea ticket next year!</p>
<p class="help-block">The registrations for the general sale are shuffled in a “lottery” ensuring that everyone registered has an equal chance of being offered a ticket. General ticket sales for Hyperborea opens on February 16th, 2021.</p>
<p class="help-block">Available tickets are then offered in the order of the lottery, and registrants have [two] days to buy their available ticket before it’s added back to the pool and offered to the next in the list.</p>
<p class="help-block">If you register for a ticket after sales are already in progress, you simply get added to the bottom of the list.</p>
